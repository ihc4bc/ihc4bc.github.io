# Before Attempting to Download ....

Please read this section before attempting to download the dataset.

The dataset contains near 2 TB of images which are uploaded to [pcloud](https://www.pcloud.com/), in the following address:


https://filedn.com/laHPyhQ5wAHBUyNr64yhV0Q/IHC4BC_Dataset/


Pcloud has a limited download quota to be deducted from either the uploader's or the downloader's limit.
These limits are reset monthly for each user.
So if you failed to download the images due to the uploader's download quota being exceeded, you can create a pcloud free account with a basic download quota.
If that basic quota didn't suffice, you can buy a paid pcloud account.

The labels are maintained in the following repository, and are a couple of gigabytes in total.
